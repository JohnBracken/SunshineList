The following R code performs some data analysis of the 
Ontario 2017 Sunshine list, which shows salary details of some
government employees making over $100000 per year in the province,
broken down by sector,occupation and employer.  In this analysis,
the identities of these individuals have been kept confidential
and have not been disclosed.  The total salary expenditures are
broken down by sector, profession and employer, with plots showing
the top 10-15 highest spending categories in each group.

A linear regression analysis was also done to determine if there
was a relationship between salary and taxable benefits.  This analysis
showed no such correlation between these two metrics.
